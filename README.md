# 🎮 Valo Buddy

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-early%20development-yellow)

**Valo Buddy** is a Valorant companion web app designed to help players quickly check their daily shop, view player stats, explore bundles and accessories, and (eventually) customize their in-game loadouts — all in one place.

This project is an **early-stage learning project** built with modern web technologies and public Valorant APIs while I study for my computer science bachelor.

Expect breaking changes, incomplete features, and experimentation as the project evolves.
